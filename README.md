<h3 id='description'>Description of Project</h3>
<p>The Verbal Diary App is the perfect tool for taking notes - whatever they may be. Whether it's a grocery list, lyrics, a letter, or notes for a class, this app is perfect for the busy individual who needs to jot something down. The sever.js folder had to be in the root folder in order to deploy to Heroku, based on errors I was getting. Once I moved the server.js folder to the root folder, my notes page would not deploy properly. I had a friend explain that for it to run, it needed to be in the same folder as the db and public files. I wanted to add the ability to edit saved notes, but I wasn't able to add that feature yet.</p><br>
